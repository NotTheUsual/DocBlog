# DocBlog

Simple blog, made to remind myself that I can still code Rails apps. Uses [Ben Balter's Word To Markdown gem](https://github.com/benbalter/word-to-markdown) to allow you to blog from Word (roughly).

There's not much on the Master branch yet, but the Posts branch has a nice implementation, with a terrible UI. Unfortunately also where I'm trying to update the Word To Markdown Gem.

### Angular

The Angular branch has an implementation of the upload window using Angular JS. It's not tested, and nothing gets saved yet (as that sort of wasn't the point of the experiment) but it does work pretty well. You drop your Word HTML file on the page, and immediately you get the parsed markdown, and a preview of the text. Which is kinda cool. There's a small video of it [here](https://twitter.com/jadhunter/status/463645797599694849).

This is obviously a work in progress/when I have time for it thing. Always nice to have something to tinker with.
